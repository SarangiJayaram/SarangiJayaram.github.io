I am a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's in Technology from the Department of Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. My main interests lie in the domains of public transportation and analysis of human behaviour in the context of travel. 
I am currently working on my Bachelor's Thesis, which focuses on the [NCRTC](https://ncrtc.in/) and its efforts to implement a novel mode of high-speed transport in the NCR Region. As a MITACS Globalink Research Intern, I had worked at the University of Saskatchewan, Sasakatoon in the summer of 2023. My project revolved around the assessment of public perceptions in response to transitional periods in active transportation modes. In my third year, I had worked in the Transportation Research Devision as a [YRF Fellow](https://yrf.iitm.ac.in/), to analyse Chennai's public transportation systems from a network science perspective.
