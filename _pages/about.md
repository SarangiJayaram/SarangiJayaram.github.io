I am a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing a B.Tech from the Department of Civil Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. My main interests lie in the domains of public transportation and analysis of human behaviour in the context of travel. 

I am currently working on my Bachelor's Thesis, which focuses on the [NCRTC](https://ncrtc.in/) and its efforts to implement a novel mode of high-speed transport in the NCR Region. As a [MITACS Globalink Research Intern](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink), I had worked at the University of Saskatchewan, Sasakatoon in the summer of 2023. My project revolved around the assessment of public perceptions in response to transitional periods in active transportation modes. In my third year, I had worked in the Transportation Research Division as a [YRF Fellow](https://yrf.iitm.ac.in/), to analyse Chennai's public transportation systems from a network science perspective.

As a part of my extracurricular engagements, I had headed a team to organise the [Space Tech Summit](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/iit-madras-students-to-organise-space-tech-summit/articleshow/97330465.cms), as a part of [Shaastra](https://shaastra.org/), the annual technical festival of IITM (2023). I had also been a member of Mind Trials, a team that sought to increase general awareness of the behavioural sciences among the public, and developed quality behavioural interventions to tackle pressing societal issues like pedestrian safety, healthier sanitation and nutrition practices.  

When I am not engaged in activities, I usually enjoy reading books or drawing. Some of my more recent artwork can be found in my [art account](https://www.instagram.com/thou.art.sangria/).
